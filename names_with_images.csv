Kusal Mendis†,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Blessed with a compact technique, an aggressive impulse, and an iron resolve, Kusal Mendis rose rapidly through the age-group system, and quickly became one of the most promising young batsmen in the world. He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four.

De Silva had been picked on potential in Sri Lanka's mid-year T20s against Pakistan, in 2015, but didn't quite convince he was a T20 batsman, hitting 45 off 47 balls across two innings.

Mohammad Rizwan†,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper Batter,"For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwan's international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often.

However, he managed to gain some attention in the 2015 National T20 Cup in where he picked up eight wickets in four matches under the captaincy of Shoaib Malik. His 17 wickets at 17.05 in the National One-Day cup in 2016 was a key part of him being promoted to the Pakistan side.

Shadab Khan,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,"A prodigious turner of the ball, teenage legspinner Shadab Khan burst onto cricket's collective consciousness only during the 2016/17 PSL season. His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch.

The accolade everybody anticipated became his three years later, when Alastair Cook stood down after the 2016-17 tour of India.

In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai.

No player in Test history had started with a bigger bang - Vinod Kambli had 796 runs after his own ninth innings - and not even Brook's anticlimactic tenth innings (run out without facing in England's thrilling one-run defeat at Wellington) could take the gloss off his achievement.

Liam Livingstone,England,Right hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,"The sense that Liam Livingstone is a domineering batting talent who will end up playing all three formats for England was strengthened by an excellent maiden Championship double-century for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in 2017. He had begun the season billed as the ""belligerent face of England's next generation"" after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level.

One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India.

Mitchell Starc,Australia,Left hand Bat,Bowler,"First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals.",Left arm Fast,

At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon.
